Robots!
=====

CAUTION: This is a bleeding-edge repo! It contains all of my work for my robot YouTube tutorials thus far - most of the code in here has not been officially distributed into the other repo. Feel free to use but be warned that any programs in here may be unpolished/unfinished. Proceed with caution!

Robots are awesome. That is a fact. I am The Raspberry Pi Guy and I am going to show you how to build your first robot. That makes me awesome too. Deal with it ;-)

This repo accompanies my robotics series which can be found here: http://youtu.be/_hDy9WY5UM0
